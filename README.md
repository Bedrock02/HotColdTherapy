## Hot & Cold Timer (Therapy)
This is a Progressive Web Application, which means you can download this app onto your desktop, mobile, and tablet.

### Goal
The goal of this application was to create a web version of [React Native Application](https://github.com/Bedrock02/Heat-Cool-Timer).

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to be able to handle timed intervals of two different states. In this case we have a hot state and a cold state. While in physical therapy I was asked to apply 1 minute of heat (hot water) and 30 seconds of ice (cold water) to my injury. I was to repeat this for at least 15 mins.

After trying run a Hot & Cold Session on my injury with just my phone I found to be distracted and lost track of the correct state I should be in. Hence why I created this application. The colors and images help provide the user with an indication of when to "switch"
